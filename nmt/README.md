## NMT 

A question answering system that is robust to out-of-distribution datasets, utilizing the method of data augmentation via backtranslation To enhance the generality of the QA model, neural machine translation models (source-to-pivot languages and pivot-to-source languages) were deployed at the subword level (BiLSTM encoder + LSTM decoder architecture with multiplicative attention).
